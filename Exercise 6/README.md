# The full real-world package

In this final exercise of the IoT with Python hackathon, you'll explore the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico to connect to the web and serve data over a network. This exercise aims to familiarize you with basic web server concepts, allowing your IoT devices to interact with web-based interfaces.

## Objective

Set up Home Assistant and use all the things you've learned so far to create a setup you would use at your home. You will connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to Home Assistant via HTTP or MQTT and have it send sensor data.

## Instructions

1. Setup the Home Assistant docker container - See the provided resource for detailed instructions.

2. **Home Assistant Integration**: Configure Home Assistant to integrate with your Raspberry Pi Pico. You can do this by setting up the MQTT integration if you plan to use MQTT or by ensuring Home Assistant is ready to receive HTTP requests, like you did in a previous exercise.

3. **Network Configuration and Protocol Selection**: Decide whether you will use HTTP or MQTT for communication between the Raspberry Pi Pico and Home Assistant. Update your network configuration on the Pico accordingly. If you choose MQTT, ensure you have an MQTT broker running and that both Home Assistant and the Pico are configured to use it.

4. **Sensor Configuration**: Connect your desired sensors to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Write or modify a Python script to read sensor data and send it to Home Assistant using the chosen protocol (HTTP or MQTT).

5. **Data Communication**:

   - If using HTTP, modify the script to make HTTP POST requests to the Home Assistant API endpoint with your sensor data. Alternatively, have Home Assistent poll the PI.
   - If using MQTT, publish sensor data to an MQTT topic subscribed to by Home Assistant.

6. **Home Assistant Automation**: In Home Assistant, create automations or scripts to react to incoming data from your Raspberry Pi Pico. This might include storing data, triggering alerts, or controlling other devices.

7. **Testing and Validation**: Ensure your Raspberry Pi Pico is properly sending sensor data to Home Assistant. You can debug by checking the Home Assistant logs and using tools like MQTT Explorer (for MQTT) or your browser (for HTTP).

8. **Iterate and Enhance**: Once you have basic communication established, consider enhancing your setup. You might add more sensors, refine your automations in Home Assistant, or improve the security of your communications.

By following these instructions, you'll create a powerful home monitoring or automation system that leverages the capabilities of both the Raspberry Pi Pico and Home Assistant.
